         <h1> MY WEB DEVELOPMENT STORY</h1>
         <img src="pexels-sharefaith-491036-1248418.jpg" alt="journet" style="width:500px; height:auto;">

        <p>Back in <B> PJ</B> where i pursued ICT as an elective,I started my journey with web development getting the basics in html and building a foundation.
         Little did i know i will find myself in GCTU studying computer science and taking Web development as a serious task.
         I came across a very charismatic and very interesting man of character Mr.Joseph Danso who pushed my limits and opened my eyes to things
         i had never seen before.

         <h2>THE EARLY JOURNEY</h2>
         <img src="pexels-pixabay-248759.jpg" alt="Journey2" style="width:500px; height:auto;">     
       <p> Early September,I embarked on my web development journey with a mix of excitement and nerves. W3Schools was my first guide, 
        patiently walking me through the basics and helping me build a foundation. 
        Then came FreeCodeCamp, where I really started to test my limits. 
        Each challenge felt like a puzzle waiting to be solved.
       As a slow learner, progress didn’t always come quickly. 
       There were moments of frustration—hours spent staring at lines of code that just wouldn’t work. But my resilience never wavered. 
       I’d dig deeper, troubleshoot endlessly, and celebrate every breakthrough, no matter how small
       Now, just a few months later, I’ve come a long way. From fixing broken code to understanding concepts that once seemed impossible, 
      I’m proud of my progress. This journey has taught me not just about web development, but also about perseverance and the power of staying the course. 
      I still have much to learn, but I’m enjoying every step of the way.
